# FOUR UP

[Four Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) (also known as Connect 4, Connect Four, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player strategy game played on a 7-column by 6-row board. Each player has a color and drops successively a disc of his color in one column, the disc falls down to the lowest empty cell of the column. The first player to make an alignment of four discs of his color wins, if the board is filled without alignment itâ€™s a draw game.
